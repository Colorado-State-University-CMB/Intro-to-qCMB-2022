# R and RStudio

Instructor: Erin Osborne Nishimura, PhD

Dates: Monday January 24, 2022 & Wednesday January 26, 2022

Welcome to the first module of CM580A3 - Introduction to Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology!

In this first module, we will explore the basics of R. What is R? R is a programming language, a coding environment, and a whole community. The goal of this module is _not_ to master R. That will take time. Here, we will just get to know a few basics of interfacing with and using R. This knowledge will help you to explore the concepts in later modules.
