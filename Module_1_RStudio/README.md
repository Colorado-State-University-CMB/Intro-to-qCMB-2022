# R and RStudio

*Monday, January 24, 2022*

Welcome to the first module of CM580A3 - Quantiatative Cell Molecular Biology. This course will take us on a tour of different computational biology approaches and techniques. This year, we will emphasize R for many modules. This will give you a chance to gain familiarity with R. What is R? R is a programming language, a computing environment, and a larger community. 

The point of this first module is _not_ to establish a mastery of the R language. That will take a long time. This module will introduce you to some of the basic concepts and practices you will need for future modules.


## Learning objectives for the module

  * Students and instructors are invited to start fresh regarding their pre-conceived notions of programming, computation, coding, and "geeks".
  * Students will become familiar with what R and RStudio are. Students will learn how these tools are used and why they are beneficial.
  * Students will download R and RStudio and become familiar with the basic operations of interfacing with R
  * Students will learn how R is structured around line-by-line commands that combine objects (nouns) and functions (verbs) into a meaningful dialog
  * Students will become familiar with a few key, starter R objects
  * Students will learn how to execute some basic functions
  * Students will learn how to import and export data
  * Students will learn to use packages to extend and specialize R's capabilities
  * Students will learn some introductory plotting functions
