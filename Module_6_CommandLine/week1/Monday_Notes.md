# Introduction to the command line

## What is the command line?

User interfaces to the operating system (kernel) are considered a (shell). These include the windowing systems that we're used to, called graphical user interfaces
(GUIs).  The command line interface is a text-based shell where you launch programs, handle files, and manage the computer using typed commands.

## What does it look like?

The command line consists of 1) the prompt and 2) blank space for you to type your command. The prompt is usually terminated by a single character.
% command1 command2
$ command1 command2
```

By default, most setups make it so the prompt shows useful information, such as your present working directory, username, computer name, etc.

```
david@Cumbernauld /Users/David % cd /
david@Cumbernauld / % whoami
david
david@Cumbernauld / % 
```
