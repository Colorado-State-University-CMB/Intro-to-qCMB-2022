Using R on Summit.

See another example R environment setup here: https://github.com/Colorado-State-University-CMB/Intro-to-qCMB-2022/blob/main/Module_6_CommandLine/README.md#an-example-r-environment

To get ready:

Open Github desktop and Fetch/Pull. Go to the directory R_on_Summit.

Steps:
1. Configure R environment on Summit if you haven't already. Install libraries if needed.
2. Convert your RMarkdown to an R script (.R) using knitr::purl.
3. Upload .R script to Summit, wrap in a bash/sbatch script for submission.
4. Further development can be done on your computer, but you'll have to repeat step 2.
