Hello CM580A3!

This module provides a very brief introduction to microbiome analysis and statistics. To prepare, you only need to have RStudio and to download each of the files in this module into the same folder somewhere on your computer. If at the end of this module you want to know more about microbiome data analysis, please sign up for our 2-day workshop on August 15th-16th at CSU (email Heather Deel, hdeel@colostate.edu for more details).
