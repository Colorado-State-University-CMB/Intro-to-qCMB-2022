```{r}
#Load library
library(tidyverse)
library(coronavirus)
update_dataset()
```


## Upload/look at the data:
```{r}
#save dataset as an object
coronavirus <- coronavirus


#explore the data
head(coronavirus, n = 20)
tail(coronavirus, n = 20)
str(coronavirus)

```


## Clean up the data: make a smaller dataset that only includes what we're interested in:
```{r}

#1. Select data from the last date of entry
#2. take out rows with missing values
#3. select only the columns we are interested in
#4. Add total number of cases per country
#5. Arrange in descending order


covid_df <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type != "recovery",
         !is.na(population)) %>%
  select("country", "type", "cases", "population") %>%
  group_by(country, type) %>%
  summarise(population = sum(population), cases = sum(cases), type, population) %>%
  unique () %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_cases))

# covid_df <- coronavirus %>% 
#   filter(date == max(date), country == "US"),
#          !is.na(population)) %>%
#   select("country", "type", "cases", "population") %>%
#   group_by(country, type) %>%
#   summarise(population = sum(population), cases = sum(cases), type, population) %>%
#   unique () %>%
#   group_by(country) %>%
#   mutate(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
#   arrange(desc(total_cases))

#explore the data
head(covid_df, n = 20)
tail(covid_df, n = 20)
str(covid_df)



```



## Explore the top 15 countries with COVID-19 cases with a simple bar plot
```{r}
#explore the data
covid_df_top15 <- head(covid_df, n = 30)


#ggplot it!
ggplot(covid_df_top15) +
  aes(group_by(country), x = cases, y = (reorder(country, cases))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") 



#ggsave it!

            

```




## Challenge: plot of COVID cases in the US
```{r}

library(knitr)
include_graphics("covid_us_plot.png")
```


## COVID in the US
```{r}

#filter for the US
covid_us <- covid_df %>%
  filter(country == "US")
  

#explore the data
covid_us

```


```{r}


#explore the data
covid_us

#ggplot it!






#ggsave it!


```


## Now plot multiple countries
```{r}

#explore the data
covid_df_top15

#ggplot it!






#ggsave it!

```

################

## Sometimes you need variables as column names - like confirmed, deaths and recovery -> Pivor wider!

covid_df

#pivot wider to have confirmed, death and recovery be column names, then arrange on descending order of cases

```{r}

covid_df_wider <- pivot_wider(covid_df,
            names_from = "type",
            values_from = cases) %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(total_cases, population = sum(population), confirmed_total = sum(confirmed), death_total = sum(death), recovery_total = sum(recovery)) %>% 
  unique () %>%
 arrange(desc(total_cases))

#explore the data
head(covid_df_wider, n = 20)
tail(covid_df_wider, n = 20)
str(covid_df_wider)


```

## Make a plot of the top 15 countries with covid cases using geom_point, then add data as aesthetics.
```{r}

#explore the data
covid_df_wider

#ggplot it!





      
#ggsave it!

```
